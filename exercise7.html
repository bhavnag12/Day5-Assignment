  <h2>Exploring the Universe</h2>
  <p>
    The universe encompasses all of space, time, matter, and energy.
     It includes everything we can observe and much more, potentially even regions beyond our current observational capabilities. 
     The universe is thought to have originated from the Big Bang and has been expanding ever since.
